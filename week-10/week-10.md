# Week 10 Notes

- Going to not do the tutorial I wrote --> hoping some people will ask questions though so I can make note of anything unclear
- [Working with Data in Tabular Format](https://melaniewalsh.github.io/Intro-Cultural-Analytics/Data-Analysis/Data-Analysis.html)
  - Definitely need this right now ty Melanie Walsh
  - Interrogation of data --> very useful questions that I'm putting all here for future reference
    - Who collected this data?
    - How and why was this data collected?
    - What assumptions are present in this data?
    - What are the consequences of this data in the world?
    - What does this data reflect about the world?
  - `.sample()`
    - Random sample of rows
  - `.describe()`
    - Calculate summary statistics for every numerical column
    - `.describe(include='all')` for addition of non-numeric columns
  - `slave_voyages_df['percent_women'].fillna('no gender information recorded')`
    - Fill the NaN values in the DataFrame with a different value
  - `slave_voyages_df.groupby('national_affiliation')`
    - Groups data by specified columns
  - `film_df = film_df.drop_duplicates(keep='first')`
    - check for duplicated rows and drops the instances after the first
  - `pd.merge(characters, metadata, on='script_id')`
    - Like SQL --> merge specified tables on column that they have in common
- Datasette Brainstorm
  - ~TO DO: Look at GLAM workbench for final notebook inspo so you know what data you specifically need~
  - [Create large composite images from snipped words](https://glam-workbench.github.io/trove-newspapers/#create-large-composite-images-from-snipped-words)
    - I want to do more with the scraper I made for Canadiana for downloading cookbooks --> make it download all cookbooks associated with search "cookery ottawa"
    - Create composite images from title pages or ads?
    - 20th century might be most interesting
  - [A random item from Museums Victoria's collections](https://glam-workbench.github.io/museumsvictoria/#a-random-item-from-museums-victorias-collections)
    - Could this be done with the Ingenium collection? --> items would have to be filtered to ensure there's an image associated with them
    - What happens when items are removed from the context of their collection? how might this cause the item to be reinterpreted? --> could be interesting to have this notebook also list the metadata for users to read
  - [Using screenshots to visualise change in a page over time](https://glam-workbench.github.io/web-archives/#using-screenshots-to-visualise-change-in-a-page-over-time)
    - This could be interesting to look at the more HCI aspect of CHI --> look at one of Ottawa's GLAM institute's home page
    - Analyze how accessible information is about both the institution itself and their collections
