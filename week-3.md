# HIST4916 Notes: Week 3

- Annotations
  - Need plan of attack --> usually I struggle with reading and annotating
  - Download readings on to iPad for reading
    - How do I download the blog post...
      - SOLVED: Go to blog post, select `File > Print...` from menu bar, go to advanced setting, select `Open PDF in Preview`, then save the preview
  - Highlight significant quotes
  - Write annotations in margins if thought of
  - Return to highlighted quotes and expand on importance
  - Type up annotations and add to actual document
    - NOTE: Page annotation for "Build and they will Come?" article being done by Will

- Intro to Python
  - Always good to refresh knowledge and/or learn better programming practices
  - Python Basics I
    - I wonder how messed up people will get learning that you can multiply an `int` and a `string` but nothing else
    - Saving `input()` for future reference:
      ```
      # A program to greet the user by name
      print('Hi. What is your name?') # Ask the user for their name
      user_name = input() # Take the user's input and put it into the variable user_name
      print('Pleased to meet you, ' + user_name) # Print a greeting with the user's name
      ```
    - The error in the final Functions activity is that there is no error ha
  - Python Basics II
    - Ah, a review of discrete math
    - I forgot Python makes you type "and" and "or" instead of `&&`/`||`
    - Nice basic `sleep()` example:
      ```
      print('Waiting 5 seconds...')
      import time # We import the `time` module
      time.sleep(5) # We run the sleep() function from the time module using `time.sleep()`
      print('Done')
      ```
    - I'm so sad Python doesn't have switch statements
  - Python Basics III
    - I actually have nothing to note here
